# Emoji-Invader
A 2-D game built with Python.

# Purpose for the Project
I only wanted a practical understanding into how Classes are used in real problem solving situations.

# Modules
Used the Pygame module to build this game. You need to know this lol!

# Note
Feel free to look at the code and drop me a comment.
You can also decide to fork it and make changes to it to make it better.

Most likely there are some bugs in it.

Feel free to correct it if you choose to lol.
