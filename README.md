# Emoji-Invader
A 2-D game built with Python not because I'm interested in game development. 
I only wanted a practical understanding into how Classes are used in real problem solving situations.

Used the Pygame module to build this game. You need to know this lol!

Feel free to look at the code and drop me a comment.
You can also decide to fork it and make changes to it to make it better.

Most likely there are some bugs in it.

Feel free to correct it if you choose to lol.
